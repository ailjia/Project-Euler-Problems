# Project Euler Problems

This is a directory about Project-Euler problems.

Problem 1:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Problem 4: 
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
